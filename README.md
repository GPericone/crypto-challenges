# crypto-challenges
Solution of three challenges assigned for the Data &amp; System Security exam for the MS degree in Cybersecurity.

The first challenge consists of deciphering ciphertext, the encryption of which is achieved through a password (a combination of "stefano" in lowercase combined with a number and an uppercase character) combined with a salt.

The second challenge is to create a script that scans a USB drive and extracts GPS coordinates from the metadata of the photos on the drive.

The third challenge is to create a script that simulates the behavior of a trojan, takes a screenshot of the screen every time three numbers are pressed in sequence (e.g., credit card CVV), and saves it in a hidden folder.
